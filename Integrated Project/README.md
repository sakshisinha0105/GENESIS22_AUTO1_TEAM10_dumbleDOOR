## Market Analysis
Key players in the market- Major players operating in the global Car Door Lock market include Standex International Corporation, Robert Bosch GmbH, Hirschmann Automotive GmbH, Sensata Technologies, Inc., HELLA GmbH & Co. KGaA, Hitachi Ltd., Mitsubishi Electric Corporation, DENSO CORPORATION, Johnson Electric, and Continental AG among others.
Globally, the Car Door Lock market is segmented by lock type, by distribution channel type, by vehicle type and by geographic coverage. Based on material type, the market is further segmented into manual and automatic. Automatic door locks or power locks are operated by using mechanical and electronic components. These are technically systematic locks that can be operated by remote control, and remote devices appear in the form of convenient compact battery-powered devices. Recent advances have led to the development and introduction of wearable remote-control devices that can be worn on the user’s wrist. Automatic door locks also have functions such as a central locking system. Most newer cars have a remote keyless system that can be controlled remotely using the remote-control key. When the gearbox is moved away from the "parking" position, the doors of some cars will lock. In other vehicles, when the vehicle reaches a certain speed, the door will automatically lock. These are one of some safety features that can cause people to prefer specific or specific car models. By distribution channel the market is segmented into OEM and aftermarket. The original equipment manufacturer (OEM) market segment is expected to lead the rare opportunity of vending machine lock sensor failure. In addition, the door lock sensor for the car needs to be replaced only in the event of a serious traffic accident. The slow pace of expansion of the aftermarket market is due to technological progress and increased awareness of vehicle users to maintain vehicle systems. By vehicle type the market is segmented into passenger cars, light commercial vehicles and heavy commercial vehicles. Passenger cars segment dominate the market over the forecast period. Increasing sale of passenger cars is one of the prime reasons for the dominance of car door lock over the forecast period. As more and more commercial vehicles are adopted worldwide, LCV has a considerable share. The booming logistics industry is increasing the demand for car door over the forecast period.

## Market Analysis
A side-view mirror also known as a wing mirror, is a mirror placed on the exterior of motor vehicles for the purposes of helping the driver see areas behind and to the sides of the vehicle, outside the driver's peripheral vision. 
The side mirror is equipped for manual or remote vertical and horizontal adjustment so as to provide adequate coverage to drivers of differing height and seated position.
Over the years, the mirror has been transformed from manual control to electronic control. Earlier the vehicle had manual control which had a joystick to adjust the blind spot and the mirror can be folded manually.
After 2010, there were many vehicles which enabled the electronic button to fold and unfold the mirror once the vehicle is turned on. Later few vehicles also gave the touch screen at the driver door which enables them to adjust the view as per their requirements. Like in the Maruti Suzuki Swift, there was manual setting along with the joystick till 2015, later models however included the electronic folding system, however the mirror adjustment is still done manually by the person driving the vehicle
Now it is an estimation that in upcoming years we can expect vehicle having intelligence sensor which will automatically detect the blind spot and adjust the mirror as per the driver without having any human intervention. In Tesla Model S, if you are driving for the first time, it asks about the personal information of the driver and next time it automatically sets the driver seat and side mirrors as the driver used it the last time used.

### Market Analysis
* Power windows or electric windows are automobile windows which can be raised and lowered by pressing a button or switch, as opposed to using a crank handle. Power assists originated in the need and desire to move convertible body-style tops up and down by some means other than human effort. The earliest power assists were vacuum-operated and were offered on Chrysler Corporation vehicles, particularly the low-cost Plymouth convertibles in the late 1930s. The "Hydro-Electric" system (windows, front seat adjustment and convertible top) was standard on 1947 model year. The seat and window assist system became available on GM closed cars (standard on some Cadillac Series 75 models and all Series 60 Specials, commonly called "Fleetwood" beginning with the 1948). The full system was standard only on the high-end GM convertibles made by Oldsmobile, Buick, and Cadillac. It was only available as a package; that is, power assisted windows, front seat, and convertible top (where applicable). This feature can be identified in 1948 and later General Motors model numbers with an "X" at the end, such as the 1951 Cadillac Sixty Special sedan, model 6019X. The electrically operated hydraulic pump system was shared by Hudson and Packard for their 1948 through 1950 models. The driver's door contained four buttons in addition to the remaining individual windows.

# Market Analysis
<p align="center">
The proposed feature of mobile missile system is one of the kind that helps the VVIP to protect them while travelling or the security force while in action.
This missile system consists of the missile, missile holder, launch system, user control which is in the steering wheel and display the information.  Most of the existing systems are used for military vehicles.
But the propsed system targets the commerially produced vehicles for the VVIP / security force.
