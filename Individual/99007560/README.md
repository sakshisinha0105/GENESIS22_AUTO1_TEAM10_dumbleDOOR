# Market Analysis
* Power windows or electric windows are automobile windows which can be raised and lowered by pressing a button or switch, as opposed to using a crank handle. Power assists originated in the need and desire to move convertible body-style tops up and down by some means other than human effort. The earliest power assists were vacuum-operated and were offered on Chrysler Corporation vehicles, particularly the low-cost Plymouth convertibles in the late 1930s. The "Hydro-Electric" system (windows, front seat adjustment and convertible top) was standard on 1947 model year. The seat and window assist system became available on GM closed cars (standard on some Cadillac Series 75 models and all Series 60 Specials, commonly called "Fleetwood" beginning with the 1948). The full system was standard only on the high-end GM convertibles made by Oldsmobile, Buick, and Cadillac. It was only available as a package; that is, power assisted windows, front seat, and convertible top (where applicable). This feature can be identified in 1948 and later General Motors model numbers with an "X" at the end, such as the 1951 Cadillac Sixty Special sedan, model 6019X. The electrically operated hydraulic pump system was shared by Hudson and Packard for their 1948 through 1950 models. The driver's door contained four buttons in addition to the remaining individual windows. 

* Automotive anti-pitch is a safety system used in the power windows of a car. The technology prevents the winding up of the window if it senses any obstacle in the path of the glass. The electric motor is fitted with a sensor that can sense the resistive force acting against the motion of the glass. As soon as the motor detects an obstacle, the closing action stops immediately and it starts operating in reverse direction. The anti-pinch power window systems help to bring down the window to avoid any injury to the occupant. The use of anti-pinch window is mandated in many countries worldwide, and this feature is provided by many automakers.
