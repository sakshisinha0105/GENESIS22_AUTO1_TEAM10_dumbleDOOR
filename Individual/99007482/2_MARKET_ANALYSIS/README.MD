## History Of Side Mirror

In the early 1940s, the roads in Europe were unpaved and consist of two lanes. Each lane for one direction. Due to this, there was a huge complexity in traffic signals for the drivers as they have to look back and both sides to avoid a major accident. Hence the OEMs came up with the idea of implementing the rear mirror placed inside the vehicle. However, the side mirror was optional for the users as it was expensive those days.  

## Progress of Side Mirror in Vehicles

In the 1970s and 1980s, the side mirror were found in most of the vehicle and it was no longer a luxury as we witnessed in early 1940s. As things progressed, side mirror became a by default mandatory component of every vehicle. 
Then in 2000, few of the automobile sectors came up with the idea of adjusting the mirror position as per the wish of the driver as earlier there was no specific function to change the view or angle of the mirror. With the advancement of technology, side mirror were later folded and unfolded using a manual joystick placed near the driver's staring wheel.

In the modern time, mirrors come with the function of folding and unfolding using a electronic button and a touch sensor to change the view of the mirror.
