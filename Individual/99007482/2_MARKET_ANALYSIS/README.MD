## History Of Side Mirror

In the early 1940s, the roads in Europe were unpaved and consist of two lanes. Each lane for one direction. Due to this, there was a huge complexity in traffic signals for the drivers as they have to look back and both sides to avoid a major accident. Hence the OEMs came up with the idea of implementing the rear mirror placed inside the vehicle. However, the side mirror was optional for the users as it was expensive those days.
