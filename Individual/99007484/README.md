## Market Analysis
Key players in the market- Major players operating in the global Car Door Lock market include Standex International Corporation, Robert Bosch GmbH, Hirschmann Automotive GmbH, Sensata Technologies, Inc., HELLA GmbH & Co. KGaA, Hitachi Ltd., Mitsubishi Electric Corporation, DENSO CORPORATION, Johnson Electric, and Continental AG among others.
Globally, the Car Door Lock market is segmented by lock type, by distribution channel type, by vehicle type and by geographic coverage. Based on material type, the market is further segmented into manual and automatic. Automatic door locks or power locks are operated by using mechanical and electronic components. These are technically systematic locks that can be operated by remote control, and remote devices appear in the form of convenient compact battery-powered devices. Recent advances have led to the development and introduction of wearable remote-control devices that can be worn on the userâ€™s wrist. Automatic door locks also have functions such as a central locking system. Most newer cars have a remote keyless system that can be controlled remotely using the remote-control key. When the gearbox is moved away from the "parking" position, the doors of some cars will lock. In other vehicles, when the vehicle reaches a certain speed, the door will automatically lock. These are one of some safety features that can cause people to prefer specific or specific car models. By distribution channel the market is segmented into OEM and aftermarket. The original equipment manufacturer (OEM) market segment is expected to lead the rare opportunity of vending machine lock sensor failure. In addition, the door lock sensor for the car needs to be replaced only in the event of a serious traffic accident. The slow pace of expansion of the aftermarket market is due to technological progress and increased awareness of vehicle users to maintain vehicle systems. By vehicle type the market is segmented into passenger cars, light commercial vehicles and heavy commercial vehicles. Passenger cars segment dominate the market over the forecast period. Increasing sale of passenger cars is one of the prime reasons for the dominance of car door lock over the forecast period. As more and more commercial vehicles are adopted worldwide, LCV has a considerable share. The booming logistics industry is increasing the demand for car door over the forecast period.
